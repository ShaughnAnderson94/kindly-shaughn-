## Installation

To run the Kindly application locally:

Fork the `enbloc-org/kindly` project to your personal github profile.  
You can do this by finding the `fork` button on the top-right corner of our repo.

Clone your new project into a local repository:

```bash
  git clone [url-to-your-forked-repo-here]
```

Go to the project directory:

```bash
  cd kindly
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```

Add env variables:

The .env.example file in the root directory shows what variables you will need. For Gmail app and AWS amplify variables you will need to ask for them on discord. To be added to the Supabase team again ask on Dicord. For Supabase variables you will need to have access to the project within Supabase (https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/secrets).

Running the app:

Make sure you are on the dev branch then use

```bash
  npm run dev
```
## Next Steps

Once you have kindly running on your machine read the [contribution guidance](CONTRIBUTING.md)
then go to the project and assign yourself an issue or create and issue yourself. Look for ones marked as good first issues.
